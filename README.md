Code for Mapping malaria by sharing spatial information between incidence and prevalence datasets 
---


This repository contains the code for the paper Mapping malaria by sharing spatial information between incidence and prevalence datasets which is now accepted for publication at the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society C.

The preprint is [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.14.20023069v1)

Unfortunately I do not have permission to share most of the data. 
I made a parallel directory of codes and simulated data which I will try to get round to hosting somewhere sensible.
It should be supplementary material with the paper as well.
