# A comparison of models for polygon data, point data or both for malaria mapping


1. user Madagascar as a case study.
2. do cross validation on both pr and polygon. no good way to convince so just have to report both in every case
3. can't see good way to compare stacked generalisation with linear polygon so have to do all linear.
4. if this paper falls out easily can expand to ml and polygon as covariates. or project for ra?
5. probably want random cv and spatial cv?
6. might need more countries but do first draft like this.
7. spatial only.
